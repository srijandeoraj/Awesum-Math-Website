        <h3>Math enrichment that challenges, motivates, and inspires students. </h3>
        <p>We've designed a math enrichment program for young students where they will complete challenging problems that promote critical thinking where they will need to think "outside the box". These problems expose students to high level concepts featured in competitive math and advanced mathematics courses alike to help prepare the future generation of math students.</p>
